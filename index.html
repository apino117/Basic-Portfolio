                When you design, you have to draw on your own fucking life experiences. If it’s not something you would
                want to read/look at/use then why fucking bother? Widows and orphans are terrible fucking tragedies,
                both in real life and definitely in typography. You won’t get good at anything by doing it a lot
                fucking aimlessly. You need to sit down and sketch more fucking ideas because stalking your ex on
                facebook isn’t going to get you anywhere. Someday is not a fucking day of the week. Respect your
                fucking craft. Practice won’t get you anywhere if you mindlessly fucking practice the same thing.
                Change only occurs when you work deliberately with purpose toward a goal. Intuition is fucking
                important. Don’t worry about what other people fucking think. Learn from fucking criticism. Nothing of
                value comes to you without fucking working at it. When you sit down to work, external critics aren’t
                the enemy. It’s you who you must to fight against to do great fucking work. You must overcome yourself.
                Don’t get hung up on things that don’t fucking work. Sometimes it is appropriate to place various
                typographic elements on the outside of the fucking left margin of text to maintain a strong vertical
                axis. This practice is referred to as exdenting and is most often used with bullets and quotations.
                Think about all the fucking possibilities. A good fucking composition is the result of a hierarchy
                consisting of clearly contrasting elements set with distinct alignments containing irregular intervals
                of
