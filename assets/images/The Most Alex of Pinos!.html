                    <p> Hi there! My name is Alex, I’m an artist. I grew up in the suburbs of DC, childhood on the
                        Maryland
                        side, teenage years in Virginia. My area in Maryland was heavily wooded so from an early age
                        I found
                        myself in love with nature and with connecting to the earth. As I got older I realized I was
                        channeling that same love into my art, I’ve always had a hand for the visual arts but my
                        real
                        affinity lies with music. To quote Albus Dumbledore music is “a magic beyond all we do here”
                        and
                        although the “here” to which he was referring is the magical school Hogwarts I believe we
                        can apply
                        it to our existence as humans. What I mean when I say that is that music has ways of
                        affecting us
                        that we don’t even fully comprehend, ways we don’t even notice. If you’ve ever had someone
                        point out
                        a particular chord change or flourish and note the emotional attachment you may be familiar
                        with the
                        “ah-ha” moment of putting words to a feeling you’ve never realized you were experiencing.
                    </p>
                    <p>The reason I mention music is that it’s a very convenient metaphor for the framework with
                        which I
                        view life and communication. Just like a minor chord elicits a sad emotion there are
                        variables in
                        our day-to-day lives of which we may not be explicitly aware but which have a profound affect
                        on our
                        perception and therefore our emotions. My goal therefore as a developer is to bring an
                        artistic and
                        philosophical ethos into the context of web design and creation. In design every detail from
                        the
                        small to the large has a crucial role to play when manipulating the effect your product will
                        have.
                        Ultimately this applies to everything in life, from the color of stop signs to the width of
                        a
                        sidewalk; every single detail is relevant and chains together. When you hire me as a
                        developer
                        you’re getting someone who thinks beyond the surface level, deeper than what’s necessary;
                        what’s
                        affective. There is no opportunity too small for an artistic approach and there is no
                        product
                        without room for analysis. My ongoing work is to continue to note analyze and implement
                        artistic
                        values in every aspect of my life because ultimately I believe this will lead to a better
                        quality of
                        life not only for myself but for the whole world.
